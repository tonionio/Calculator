# Calculator

# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Chained operations: Users can chain multiple operations together, and the calculator will evaluate them in the correct order.
- Error handling: The calculator handles errors such as division by zero and invalid input.
- Clear and backspace: Users can clear the display or remove the last digit entered.
- Hover effect: The buttons have a hover effect for better user experience.

## Implementation Details

- The calculator is implemented as a single-page web application.
- The user interface is built using HTML and CSS. The calculator has buttons for each digit, each arithmetic operation, and special buttons such as "clear" and "equals".
- The calculator's functionality is implemented using JavaScript. The JavaScript code defines functions for each arithmetic operation, as well as functions for handling user input and updating the display.
- The calculator stores the current input, previous input, and current operation in variables. When the user presses the "equals" button, the calculator calls the appropriate arithmetic function and updates the display with the result.
- The calculator handles errors by displaying an error message in the display and clearing the input and operation variables.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open the `calculator.html` file in a web browser. Click the buttons to enter numbers and operations, and click the "equals" button to see the result. Click the "clear" button to start a new calculation.
